Building Pipeline:
1> Create a GitHub repo and clone it in local 
2> Add projectflow.txt to follow the actions taken
3> Create a new folder experiments and add 2 files downloaded from the Vikas Das repositories.  
One is a .ipynb file and another is a datafile which has spam details.
4> Add src folder along with all components(run them individually).

i> data_ingestion.py
ii> data_preprocessing.py
iii> feature_engineering.py
iv> model_training.py
v> model_evaluation.py

5) Add data, models, reports directories to .gitignore file
6) Now git add, commit, push
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Setting up dcv pipeline (without params)
8> Create dvc.yaml file and add stages to it.
9> dvc init then do "dvc repro" to test the pipeline automation. (check dvc dag)
10> Now git add, commit, push
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Setting up dcv pipeline (with params)
8> add params.yaml file
9> Add the params setup (mentioned below)
    i> change in the data_ingestion.py, feature_engineering.py, model_training.py
    ii> change in the dvc.yaml file to include the parameters
10> Do "dvc repro" again to test the pipeline along with the params
11> Now git add, commit, push
